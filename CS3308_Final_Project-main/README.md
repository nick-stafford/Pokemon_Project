# Project Title: Pokémon A New Age 

## Team members' names:
- Nicholas Stafford
- Jonathan Sees
- Sean Mulligan
- Naureen Bharwani

## Information for Project:
1. Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
  - We love Pokémon! Gotta catch'em all!

2. Motivation: why are you working on this project?
  - We remember playing Pokémon when we were kids and now we that we're older we want to bring back the love we experienced when we were that age. Most of the team also wanted to learn JS so this project was the perfect opportunity. Potentially using Trello as well seems like a good project tracking software to learn.

3. Risks to project completion, possibly including:
  - new language or working environment
    - Javascript seems ideal for this project but:
      - Sean, Naureen and Nick only know C++ and Python
      - Jonathan knows Javascript, learning C++ and Python
  - no prior experience working with these team members
    - Jonathan has 8 years of experience working in his career with teams
    - Naureen, Nick and Sean don't have experience with coding teams
    - Sean and Naureen have other developing/ops experience working with teams
    - None of us have worked with Trello but might try it for this project
  - lack of some needed resources
    - Most Javascript info will come from Google; lack of concrete resources
 
4. Mitigation Strategy for above risks
  - Jonathan has 8 years of experience in their career with this, so he will take the lead. Sean, Nick and Naureen will be researching more about the language and assisting Jonathan. Project will have many for loops, while loops, if/else statements. The project will be more stylic and basic in terms of the structure

5. Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
  - Using a Pokémon API
  - Going with the scrum method: 
	- 1 week spirits meeting every Wednesday
	- Tasks will be broken up into smaller pieces due to new language risk
	- Build smaller pieces and expand to larger tasks 
  - Jonathan will be the Scrum Master for this Project

6. Project Tracking Software (Trello, Github Project)
  - Github
  - Potentially Trello
